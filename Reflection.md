# Project Reflection

## Problems With Project
- one of the first problems I had with my project was dealing with the 4 characters health in battle, with the game would run
all healths would be active so when the enemy was attacking it would attack all 4 characters instead of just the one. To fix
this I had to make a bunch of statements that would determine which character the player has choosen, this allowed for the enemy to only deal damge to the players characters.

- the second proble I had was making 1 character be seen on the screen, before you could just activate all characters and their sprites would be overtop each other. This also meant that if all were seen then their moves,textbox, and health bar would be overtop each other, to fix this I did the exact same thing to fix my health issue, making a function that makes sure only one character is active meaning its values would be alive and only its sprites would be seen.

- the last big problem I had was starting the game again/ playing another round. Before when trying to play again you wouldnt be able to select a different character and the health values wouldnt be reset meaning the game would end in a instint.To fix this I reset the values when either the win or lose screen showed up and set all characters to be false meaning all could be choosen.

## Completion/Reflection
- for the given amount of time I was able to complete what I needed to have in my game, playable characters with different moves, health, and sprites. My game functions the way I wanted it to which I'm very happy about. If given more time I would have done a lot more such as making move animations, more sounds being implemented, improving graphics. One of the things that I would've really wanted to add was a overworld to walkthrough kinda like pokemon, Persona or EarthBound. I also would've made my code look better such as creating functions to do things without taking up 30 lines. Overall given more time I would make these things in my game because I feel like while the game functionality is important, the graphis a little details makes a game more appealing and fun which is the point of games.
