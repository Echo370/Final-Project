# Proposal
Creating a RPG battle system, the player will be facing a CPU where they will be using the teams given to 
them to see who can win. The players team will consist of 3 to 4 characters they will use in battle, each with different stats, moves, and abilities. Stats will consist of Attack, HP, Defence, Elemental attack, and Elemental defence. Each character will be given 3 move slots. And lastly each character will have their own ablility unique to them that improves performance in battle. Will be a max of 4 to 6 characters used in battle, the player and cpu will both have 3 to 4 usable characters. Battle will end when either the players team or CPUs team can no longer fight (characters have 0 HP).
